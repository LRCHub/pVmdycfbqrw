# void (Mournfinale) – Testify

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Darkest night
I'll confront you here
Such a destiny was not desired
In this place
I never wished to see that
Side of you
And raise
Different colors for one another
Never notice me
Never call my name
With your voice
Let me forget everything
And leave no trace of you
What am I carrying
Out in this horizon of despair?
If it's not you
I can hurt anyone
In the name of justice
Your shadow
Gets in the way of my light
And Testify
Let me forget everything
Still moonlight shines on us
Broken heart
I don't want you
To find and take a look at
So I'll sin more
And destroy my thoughts
Make a mess of my hand
I swear on the darkest night
I'll end it all
And Testify
All that I'm left
With is your reminiscences
Take me to where you are
Won't you?
Till then I'll keep struggling
Curse of justice you don't know
```
