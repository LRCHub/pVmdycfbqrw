[00:32.47] The movie ran through me
[00:34.52] The glamour subdue me
[00:36.67] The tabloid untie me
[00:38.60] I'm empty, please fill me
[00:51.10] 
[00:40.77] Mister Anchor, assure me
[00:42.63] That Baghdad is burning
[00:44.76] Your voice, it is so soothing
[00:46.96] That cunning mantra of killing
[01:01.96] 
[00:48.81] I need you, my witness
[00:50.99] To dress this up so bloodless
[00:52.93] To numb me and purge me now
[00:55.02] Of thoughts of blaming you
[01:08.02] 
[00:56.87] Yes, the car is our wheelchair
[00:59.12] My witness, your coughing
[01:00.93] Oily silence mocks the legless
[01:03.14] Ones who travel now in coffins
[01:18.14] 
[01:05.03] On the corner
[01:06.89] The jury's sleepless
[01:08.89] We found your weakness
[01:11.19] And it's right outside your door
[01:27.19] 
[01:13.07] Now testify
[01:16.87] Now testify
[01:19.63] It's right outside your door
[01:21.14] Now testify
[01:25.14] Yes, testify
[01:27.92] It's right outside your door
[01:41.92] 
[01:29.77] With precision you feed me
[01:31.98] My witness, I'm hungry
[01:33.90] Your temple, it calms me
[01:36.14] So I can carry on
[01:44.64] 
[01:38.10] My slaving, sweating
[01:40.17] The skin right off my bones
[01:41.86] On a bed of fire, I'm choking
[01:44.17] On the smoke that fills my home
[01:59.67] 
[01:46.37] The wrecking ball is rushing
[01:48.63] Witness, you're blushing
[01:50.50] The pipeline is gushing
[01:52.53] While here we lie in tombs
[02:05.53] 
[01:54.00] While on the corner
[01:56.12] The jury's sleepless
[01:58.03] We found your weakness
[02:00.44] And it's right outside your door
[02:16.44] 
[02:02.14] Now testify
[02:06.21] Yeah, testify
[02:08.86] It's right outside your door
[02:10.38] Now testify
[02:14.56] Now testify
[02:17.09] Well, it's right outside your door
[02:34.09] 
[02:19.17] Mass graves for the pump and the price is set
[02:21.75] And the price is set
[02:23.18] Mass graves for the pump and the price is set
[02:25.84] And the price is set
[02:27.12] Mass graves for the pump and the price is set
[02:29.63] And the price is set
[02:31.18] Mass graves for the pump and the price is set
[02:33.68] And the price is set
[02:43.68] 
[02:51.34] Who controls the past now controls the future
[02:55.56] Who controls the present now controls the past
[02:59.45] Who controls the past now controls the future
[03:03.34] Who controls the present now?
[03:17.84] 
[03:06.50] Now testify
[03:10.96] Testify
[03:13.21] It's right outside your door
[03:14.77] Now testify
[03:18.93] Testify
[03:21.58] It's right outside your door
