Testify
Roachford

If i testify would you curse my name
Never call me friend again
If i testify, if i shared with you my past
The darkest hours would you set me free at last
If i testify, if i testify
And wouldn't i still be the person you love
And couldn't i still be the person you need
And wouldn't i still be the person you love
And couldn't i still be the person you need
If i testify 'cause this morning i will testify
So if and when i testify, if and when i testify
Wouldn't i still be the person you love
And wouldn't i still be the person you need
I wanna know if i could tell everything
Wish i could tell everything
(Repeat to end)
