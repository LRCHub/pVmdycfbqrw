Yeah a boy and girl, in a mixed up world
But ain't nothin' wrong, with the life
That we can make, shelter me
Help me breathe, let's celebrate a lifetime
Made for us

Longer an' last and the better it gets
Longer an' last and the better it gets
Falling in love I've got no regrets
Bring it down on me

So we can testify, you and I
Love has got me on a mighty high
Testify, baby baby you and I
I'm gonna testify 'cause you're
The reason why

Born to a kiss, a little tenderness
You know it ain't no sin to be glad
That you're alive, my soul mate
I can't contemplate, a solo life so come on
Lets make a lifetime

Longer an' last and the, better it gets
Longer an' last and the, better it gets
Reach out for me, hold me
Tight and let's, bring it down on me

So we can testify, you and I
Love has got me on a mighty high
Testify, sweet baby baby
You and I, baby please let's make
Some memories

What I believe in your magic spell
I believe only time will tell
Every love has got it's problems
We'll solve 'em, so take my hand
And make, a stand love will conquer all

Longer an' last and the, better it gets
Longer an' last and the, better it gets
Longer an' last, longer an' last

Yeah yeah, so we can testify
You and I
Love has got me on a mighty high

Testify, oh sweet baby baby, you and I
You're the reason why I'm early
Its the kind of lovin' I do believe
Its the kind of lovin' that we can achieve
I believe

Its the kind of love I do believe
Its the kind of lovin' that we can achieve
I believe

Its the kind of love I do believe
